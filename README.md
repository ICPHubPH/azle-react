# ICP Development Environment with Azle and React

This template gives you everything you need to build a full-stack Web3 application on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).
It includes a frontend built with Vite and React, and a backend written in JS/TS (Azle).

## Get started with one click:
### Locally:

Make sure you have you have the latest version of Docker (e.g. >25) and VS Code installed and running, then click the button below

### In your browser:

In Gitpod

## üöÄ Develop

When the editor opened, run the following commands to start a local ICP node and deploy the canister smart contract:

```bash
dfx start --clean # Start a local ICP node
# In a new terminal window:
dfx deploy # Deploy smart contract locally
```

The smart contract will be reachable under `http://bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai.localhost:4943`.
Call the smart contract using `curl` on the command line: 

```bash
# create configuration
curl -X POST http://bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai.localhost:4943/configuration/insert -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"key": "site_name", "value": "ICP HUB PH"}'
# update configuration
curl -X POST http://bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai.localhost:4943/configuration/update -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"key": "site_name", "value": "ICP HUB Philippines"}'
# delete configuration
curl -X POST http://bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai.localhost:4943/configuration/delete -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"key": "site_name"}'
# get configurations endpoint
curl http://bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai.localhost:4943/configurations

```
You can also use tools like Postman or HTTPie to interact with the smart contract.
To redeploy the smart contract, run `dfx deploy` again.

When ready, run `dfx deploy --ic` to deploy your application to the ICP mainnet.
The command will print a different canister URL for mainnet, ending in `.raw.icp0.io`.
You can make calls to the smart contract on mainnet just like to the local one!

## üí° Tips and Tricks

- When developing remotely, navigating to the canister's frontend in the browser will not work.
Use `curl` on the command line instead, or develop locally.

- If you get an error "Error: An error happened during communication with the replica: ... Connection refused", run `dfx start --clean` to start dfx.
